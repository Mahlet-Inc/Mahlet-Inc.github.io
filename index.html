                <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Hobbits is a software platform for analyzing, processing, and visualizing bits.
The Hobbits GUI is the central tool of the platform, and will be the primary
focus of this document. However, the configurability and extensibility of the
analysis and processing parts of the platform make it an attractive option for
"headless" operation (e.g. a command line utility, or an analysis/processing
server.)</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Hobbits was developed to accelerate manual data analysis tasks that were
starting to burden Mahlet's hardware and software development. The de facto
solution involved the use of multiple tools with slow turnaround and improvised
integration (e.g. custom Python scripts and xxd.) Hobbits provided a fully
integrated analysis environment without sacrificing flexibility. As a result, it
has quickly accumulated success stories across the different development teams.</p>
<p>There are tools that are similar to Hobbits, but none can claim to be as
extensible, portable, and flexible. GUI and plugin binaries can be easily
dropped, swapped, and executed on a variety of platforms without dependencies
or restrictions. This is a priceless advantage when developing analysis
tradecraft across a variety of communities, networks, or access levels.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What Now?</h2>
<p>The general architecture of Hobbits has proven to be highly effective and agile,
so the current development priorities are refining the GUI, and adding more
plugins.</p>
<h1 id="hobbits-gui">Hobbits GUI</h1>
<p>The primary concern of Hobbits GUI is making machine-level data presentable to
humans so that they can analyze/fix/generate it easily. This usually involves
some level of processing, analysis, and visualization. One workflow could be
counting the number of bytes and looking at a hex dump. Another could be
performing a QAM remap, finding a data width, de-muxing, and then looking at a
bit raster.</p>
<p>Hobbits simplifies the task of developing and repeating these workflows within a
single application.</p>
<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>All analysis, processing, and visualization capabilities of Hobbits are provided
dynamically with plugins. (The plugin system is described in depth
<a href="#plugin-system">here</a>.)</p>
<p>While the current collection of capabilities provides a uniquely fast, easy, and
portable experience, the true power of the platform lies in its ability add new
plugins that further customize and optimize desired workflows. Thoughtful
architectural planning has allowed several plugins to be developed within a few
hours - an example plugin was even created within a few minutes during a live
demo!</p>
<p>The ease of extensibility provided by the plugin system will enable core feature
development to proceed rapidly, and even opens up the possibility of externally
developed plugin collections.</p>
<h3 id="displays">Displays</h3>
<p>Displays are critical because the information bandwidth of the average human
optical physiology is very high. Variety and configurability are necessary for
showing the most important charactaristics of different types of data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bit Raster: shows frames of bits as raster lines in which each pixel
   represents a bit</li>
<li>Byte Raster: same as the Bit Raster, but each pixel represents a byte</li>
<li>Symbol Raster: same as the Bit Raster, but each pixel is a configurable
   bit-length "symbol" with a correlating custom color</li>
<li>Binary: shows frames of bits as lines of binary digits</li>
<li>Hex: shows frames of bits as lines of hexadecimal digits</li>
<li>ASCII: shows frames of bits as lines of decoded ASCII text</li>
<li>Digraph Plot: shows byte adjacency patterns</li>
<li>Dot Plot: shows byte repetition patterns</li>
<li>Hilbert Plot: shows byte sections in visibly delineated chunks</li>
<li>Frequency Plot: shows a histogram of the most common bytes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analyzers">Analyzers</h3>
<p>Analyzers digest and decorate the data in a way that facilitates follow-on
processing and/or human evaluation. Analyzers are non-destructive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find: finds and navigates to bit, hex, octal, and ASCII patterns in the data</li>
<li>Width Framer: frames the data to given bit-width. Includes an
   auto-correlation function and width-picker graph.</li>
<li>Kaitai Struct: highlights the data sections based on a known/specified binary
   format</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
<p>Operators take some number of data inputs, and produce some number of data
outputs. Most operators are 1-in, 1-out, but the flexibility of the interface
enables several critical operations (e.g. data generators, muxes, demuxes.)
The output of operators will go into new containers so that the original data
can still be easily referenced.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take Skip: performs common bitwise pre-processing operations using a
   simple-yet-powerful "take, skip" syntax</li>
<li>Bit Error: injects bit errors into the data</li>
<li>LFSR: generates LFSR bits based on given parameters</li>
<li>QAM Remapper: maps n-bit "symbols" to other n-bit "symbols"</li>
<li>Header Framer: frames the data on a given constant header sequence</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="importerexporters">Importer/Exporters</h3>
<p>Importer/Exporters are the primary way to get bitstreams in and out of hobbits.</p>
<ul>
<li>File Data: import bits from or export bits to a file on the filesystem</li>
<li>HTTP Data: import bits from or export bits to an HTTP URL</li>
<li>Hex String: import bits from or export bits to an ASCII string of hex
   characters that represent the bits</li>
<li>TCP Data: import bits by listening for TCP data on a specified port, or
   export bits to a TCP server at a specified address</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>When a user develops a sequence of operations that they want to perform
frequently, they can save it as a "Template" and perform it later with a single
step. Templates can also be used to process bits on the command line with the
hobbits-runner CLI.</p>
<h1 id="technical-architecture">Technical Architecture</h1>
<p>The rest of this document covers the technical architecture of the Hobbits 
platform.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>The architecture of Hobbits is best understood through the lens of the
challenges it faces in satisfying its user goals.</p>
<h3 id="required-capabilities-are-unpredictable">Required capabilities are unpredictable</h3>
<p>The problem space that can be approached with a "bitwise analysis,
processing, and visualization" tool is vast, even when scoped to a specific
domain like high-speed networks. Hobbits must be prepared for unexpected
features.</p>
<h3 id="required-capabilities-are-numerous">Required capabilities are numerous</h3>
<p>A large problem space also leads to a large number of capabilities being
integrated, and each newly integrated capability beckons adjacent capabilities
to be integrated, and so on. Hobbits must be prepared for a lot of features. </p>
<h3 id="required-capabilities-are-performance-intensive">Required capabilities are performance-intensive</h3>
<p>When working with large amounts of data at the bit level, it is critical to use
processing cycles and memory efficiently. An effective interface and core
library needs to ensure that simple capabilities have efficient abstractions
available, while high-performance capabilities are unencumbered by abstraction.
Hobbits must provide lean interfaces and fast utilities.</p>
<h3 id="implemented-capabilities-need-to-work-together">Implemented capabilities need to work together</h3>
<p>Decoupling capabilities from one another in a plugin system makes it harder for
them to coordinate with each other and create the smoothest experience possible.
Hobbits must provide ways of orchestrating multiple plugins cleanly, and the
plugin interface must allow safe, opportunistic coordination between plugins.</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<h3 id="cqt">C++/Qt</h3>
<p>Using C++ and the Qt framework as the foundation for Hobbits makes it easier to
meet performance requirements, and trivializes the process of turning existing
C/C++ programs into plugins. This is useful because many performance-critical
data analysis and processing capabilities are written in C/C++.</p>
<p>Qt enables rapid GUI design as well as a variety of well-documented convenience
tools, such as a plugin loading system.</p>
<h3 id="plugin-system">Plugin System</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, all analysis, processing, and visualization capabilities of
Hobbits are provided dynamically with plugins. This makes it easy to add new
and unexpected capabilities without increasing the complexity of adding <em>more</em>
new and unexpected capabilities. This kind of development scaling can be
achieved without plugins, but plugins <em>guarantee</em> it. Furthemore, plugins enable
the program to be extended without any updates to the core program.</p>
<p>The plugin interfaces grant a lot of implementation flexibility while
maintaining a narrow, inflexible coupling to the core program. The flexibility
enables the addition of unpredictable capabilities, while the clear coupling
enables useful integration between plugins.</p>
<p>Another important consideration of the plugin system design was implementation
speed and ease. Adding new plugins needs to be fast and painless. The simplicity
of the essential interface components helps with this, but the core library
utilities and the plugin templates are also very important.</p>
<p>Finally, a plugin system allows Mahlet (or any other organization) to develop
plugins that can be used internally, or licensed and sold separately from the
core Hobbits open-source project.</p>
<h3 id="core-library">Core Library</h3>
<p>The core library's main purpose is to provide useful tools and abstractions for
the plugin implementations. This includes ways of accessing and operating on
packed bits, and partial implementations of common plugin types (e.g. displays
that show zoomable characters,) among other conveniences.</p>
<p>The core library also contains useful capabilities for managing the integration
of different plugins in a sensible way. The Hobbits GUI relies heavily on these
default integration managers, and as a result is less than 1000 lines of code.
Other applications would be able to similarly leverage the core library, so
custom Hobbits command line utilities and processing servers could feasibly be
created (or added to existing programs) in a matter of hours rather than
days/weeks.</p>
<h3 id="templates_1">Templates</h3>
<p>Even with rigorous simplification of the plugin interfaces and useful
abstractions of the Qt plugin loader, there is still a small amount of
boilerplate code required when making a plugin. This boilerplate code can be
annoying to experienced developers, and it can be intimidating to developers
that are unfamiliar with the program.</p>
<p>Templates, in the form of Qt Creator wizards, are
available to set up all of the boilerplate code required to make a functioning
plugin. This dramatically speeds up the development of new plugins, especially
simple plugins, and plugins that just wrap existing C/C++ processing
capabilities.</p>
